## Competitive Programming Notebook

This contains my templates and snippets for competitive programming in (mostly) Python.

## Introduction

For beginners, I recommend starting out on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/). You can try their exercises and participate in the [weekly contests](https://leetcode.com/contest/). You do not need to install anything on your computer because the IDE is online.

I also recommend starting out with Python and working on the [exercises on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/). The syntax is easier to write and understand. This [Python snippets](./docs/python_snippets.md) that I have written can to get you up to speed on what the language can offer.

Only after participating in a few contests and if you are really interested in competitive programming, you can start to get serious by participating in [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com) and [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp) contests. These platforms do not have an online IDE, and you will need to test your code on your computer.

For every competition, I will create a new branch out of `master` and edit my code in `template` folder. At the end of the competition, I will push my code to GitHub.
