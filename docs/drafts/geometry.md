# Geometry

General advice

- Geometry problems are prone to rounding errors
  - Avoid taking square root if possible.
  - Avoid converting into floats if possible.
  - You may need to allowance for rounding.



To determine whether three points lie on the same line 

-  calculate the area of the triangle defined by the three points

```python
0.5*(x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2))
```


Centre of mass

- Take the mean of each coordinate over every point



Point where the euclidean distance from each point is minimised

- Not the centre of mass
- Are there multiple unconnected solutions?
- This is the geometric median




To check whether a candidate point is inside a triangle defined by three points

- Calculate the area of the triangle
- Calculate the area of the point with two points of the triangle

Order the points such that a shape is not deformed

- I haven't seen this question yet
- 
- Use 2-Opt from TSP?



Calculate the area of a polygon defined by a sequence of points

To obtain the circle defined by three points

- assuming the points
  - are not collinear

To obtain the circle defined by two points and a radius

- assuming the points 
  - are not more than two times the specified radius
  - are not the same point
