# Coding interviews

Coding interviews is different from competitive programming.



In interviews you want to explain your method.



Please write understandable code.



From the prespective of an interviewer



In competitions we hardly differentiate between O(N) and O(N log N) solutions. However in coding interview, a O(N log N) will not pass the interview. Moreover, the space constraint is usually asked to be minimised.







Level 1: What a trivial question! Is he insulting me?
- Humility + Are you missing something / can you do better 

Level 2: This is manageable 
- I can think of a way to do it. Can you do better? 

Level 3: I have seen something like this before! 
- Are you too eager to regurgitate? Make use of this and perform well! 

Level 4: Edge of your ability: This is toughâ€¦
- Frame, identify key insight, verbalise.

Level 5: I have absolutely no idea how to start

- Stay calm and rational. Engage the interviewer for help

[I am hosting one-to-one coding interview practice and I am inviting you]

Few months back while I was waiting for my pizza I gave my friend an algorithmic problem to solve. Conducting a coding interview is not easy, especially when you are also new to the problem. If you think going for interviews is hard, conducting interviews requires no less practice.

- Firstly, you describe the problem. You need to be able to define the problem clearly, but not hinting the solution.

- You anticipate questions, if any. You need to ensure that the interviewee has a correct idea of the question.

- Hopefully, the interviewee will explain an approach. You need to be able to understand what she meant. It may not be the approach you are familiar with. Even if it is an approach that you are expected, the presentation style may make it unfamiliar.

- You need to quickly and accurately judge the proposed approach. The approach may not work, may be too slow or sometimes better than your solution. When it does not work you need to communicate why it does not work. When it is too slow you might want to wrap up the approach and discuss the time complexity and how can it be improved.

- If the interviewee gets stuck, you need to be able to provide effective hints, again not giving out the entire solution.

- For all the while you need to maintain a good image of yourself and the organisation that you are representing.

The programming interview is not merely about the solution itself, it is how you communicate to the interviewer. 

During the team coding contests that I have participated last year onsite, most of the solutions were done separately. Even after the event it was difficult to describe our approaches. I hope to practice further.

I would like to give coding interviews on a weekly basis to different interested people, for free.

Sign up link is here. I welcome you as long as you can code something, as I believe there is value introducing beginners to coding interviews.

The interview will be over a Zoom/Hangouts call and coding on CodeCollab. It would most likely be on Sunday noon and last for about an hour. We would go through two questions suitable for your capability, then we end with a chit chat.

Thanks Devi Keerthi Vutukuri for being my first virutal interviewee, and Peng Shanshan for being my first physical interviewee back in January.







If this happens to be very popular maybe I can interview two people at a time, or assign past interviewees to interview you.

### Pre-interview questions

Please educate yourself on time complexity. Ask if you have taken an algorithms course.

Understand what is O(n)



Please ensure that you have a working internet connection and video conferencing and a quiet room.

Hangouts or Zoom

Please ensure that you can screenshare
