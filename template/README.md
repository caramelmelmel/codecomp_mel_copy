# Competitive Programming Template

This contains the code template I use for competitive programming.

* auto-gen TOC:
{:toc}


### Contest preparation script

```
cd template
git checkout -b $CONTEST_NAME
code .  # open VSCode
python3 sample_gen.py  # and download test cases with jmerle/competitive-companion
jn
```

These are the command-line shortcuts that I use

```
alias ss="source /usr/local/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
alias sa="conda activate"
alias jn="jupyter notebook"
alias code="open -a /Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app"

alias t="touch"
alias cx="./run_cpp.sh"
alias px="./run_py.sh"
alias pi="./run_pi.sh"
```



### How to use (general)

Copy the test case to `a0`. If there is an expected output for the test case, copy it to `a0.out`

If there are additional test cases copy them as `a1`, `a2` etc.

`sample_gen.py` and the Competitive Companion extension will crawl and write the test cases.

In the code template, there are examples on how to IO. Uncomment and use them.




### How to use (Python)

To run the code

````bash
python a.py < a0
````

The debug statements prints in a different color.
You can submit the code without commenting out the debugging statements, I do not think it should affect the run time.

To compile the code and run for all test cases

```bash
./run_py.sh a
```

I made the above command an alias, so in contests I run

```bash
px a
```



##### Recursion

If you need to recursively call functions more than 1000 times, please use the function decorator in `recursive_example_1.py` (may not always work)



##### Interactive questions

- You can read input as usual.
- When printing, please flush, i.e. `print(x, flush=True)`
- At the end of the program, please execute `sys.exit()`



Google provides an [interactive testing tool](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/faq#interactive-problems). Google maintains an `interactive_runner.py` for all interactive problems. In each interactive problem, they provide a specific `local_testing_tool.py` for you to test your code.

You will need to write your code in `sample_interactive_script.py`.

```bash
python interactive_runner.py python3 sample_local_testing_tool.py $TEST_CASE -- python3 sample_interactive_script.py
```

I made the above command an alias, so in contests I run

```bash
pi 1
```





##### Python Algorithm Templates
The following algorithmic templates should be available.

- [AtCoder library](https://atcoder.github.io/ac-library/master/document_en/)
  - (There is a [Python](https://github.com/not522/ac-library-python) [version](https://github.com/Mitarushi/ACL-Python) but probably I want to extract copiable snippets instead of running the script to transfer the functions.

### How to use (C++)

Please refer to my [C++ conversion course](../docs/cpp_conversion_course.md)

To compile the code and run for all test cases

```
./run_cpp.sh x
```

I made the above command an alias, so in contests I run

```bash
cx a
```
